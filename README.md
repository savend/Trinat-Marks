# Introduction

The project "Trinat Marks" and the corresponding Git repository was developed as part of a project work in the course Software Engineering in the study course Mechatronics trinational. The implementation was realized with Java. 

# Goals, boundary conditions

The aim is to translate the competences learned in the subjects Programing and Software Engineering into an independent student project. Our project is a grade calculator.

The goal is to give the student an overview of his academic achievements.

He has the possibility to create individual modules and to equip them with subordinated subjects. 

Furthermore, the grades obtained during the course can be used in the languages German, French and Swiss German, whereby the student receives his grades in all 3 country scales.

The passed modules are highlighted in green, the failed modules in red. 

In addition, it is possible to save the scores that have been inserted and completed.

We want to divide the program into different classes and structure them with methods.

The condition is that this program can be used by any device.



# Build Instructions

1) Download the file from our repository in Github.

2) Extract the downloaded file into the desired folder.

3) Copy the path of the desired version file (.jar) to the clipboard.

4) Open the console of your computer

5) Enter java -jar followed by the copied path (.jar).

6) Confirm your entry with Enter.


# Operation manual
